Function Write-OGDWordWrapHost {

    .SYNOPSIS
        Write string of text to screen with a maximum line length
    .DESCRIPTION
        Writes a string of words to the screen, to a maximum width. If the maximum width would be exceeded, it starts 
        a new line and continues. The character used to determine where to break off the line is a space ( ).
    .EXAMPLE
        Write-OGDWordWrapHost This is a line of text, which is too long to write in a single line and therefore is cut off.
    .EXAMPLE
        Write-OGDWordWrapHost 'Single quotes and double "quotes" can both be used around the input text'
